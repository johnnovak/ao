# Ao

*Physically based ray tracer in Nim*

> "In the Polynesian mythology of the Maori, Ao ("daylight") is one of the
  primal deities who are the unborn forces of nature. Ao is the
  personification of light and the ordinary world, as opposed to darkness and
  the underworld. He is spoken of under many forms or manifestations,
  including Aoturoa, “enduring day, this world,” Aomarama, “bright day, world
  of light and life”. With his companions, Ata, “morning,” and Whaitua,
  “space,” Ao resists the forces of darkness."
