# Ao

*Physically based ray tracer in Nim*

> "In the Polynesian mythology of the Maori, Ao ("daylight") is one of the
  primal deities who are the unborn forces of nature. Ao is the
  personification of light and the ordinary world, as opposed to darkness and
  the underworld. He is spoken of under many forms or manifestations,
  including Aoturoa, “enduring day, this world,” Aomarama, “bright day, world
  of light and life”. With his companions, Ata, “morning,” and Whaitua,
  “space,” Ao resists the forces of darkness."

## Overview

**Ao** is a Nim implementation of [pbrt](http://www.pbrt.org/), the famous
physically based ray tracer. I am adding bits and pieces as I'm progressing
with reading the book, which is going at a leisurely pace as I'm doing this in
my free time for enjoyment.

You can follow the development at [my blog](http://blog.johnnovak.net/tag/Ao)
if you're interested.

Requires [devel branch Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim#compiling).
I regularly test the code on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

## Tests

To run all the unit tests:

```
nim c -r test/allTests
```
